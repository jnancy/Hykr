# Hykr :evergreen_tree:

Introducing a brand new health/fitness social app! (with a unique name not found in Google's play store or Apple's app store :wink: )

#### Perks:
- Perfect for active folks to plan and go on hikes with friends (especially suitable for Vancouver)
- Documents previous hikes in a gallery on the user's sleek profile

#### Key Features:
-  Google Maps API (displays user's current location + nearby hiking trails)
-  Provides trail search results using information from the Hikingproject Data API (an online hiking trails database) 
-  Azure-based backend to pull data from our database of users to display the location of the user's friends

#### Extensibility:
- can be updated to include facebook login/find friends functionalities
- can create a whole suite of apps (e.g. Bykr, Walkr, Joggr) or combine multiple activities in one app
